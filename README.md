#TASK DESCRIPTION

This project demonstrates both rule-based speech recognition (via SpeechRecognition with Google Web API) and AI-powered transcription using pre-trained models. These models have been trained on vast amounts of multilingual audio data and are capable of understanding different accents, languages, and speech patterns.

The key deliverables for this project include a functional Python script, a sample set of transcribed audio files, and documentation explaining the systemâ€™s workflow. The code can be extended to support additional features such as speaker diarization (identifying who is speaking), timestamps, or integration with text-to-speech engines for two-way voice interaction.
The architecture of the tool typically includes:

Audio Input Handling: Captures live speech via microphone or loads audio from files.

1.Preprocessing: Normalizes audio data and reduces background noise.

2.Feature Extraction: Converts audio into a form that the model can understand (e.g., Mel spectrograms).

3.Model Inference: Applies a trained ASR model to map audio features to text.

4.Output Generation: Displays or saves the recognized text.
Applications of this system are vast. In education, it can transcribe lectures or assist students with disabilities. In media, it can automate podcast and interview transcriptions. Businesses can use it for recording and summarizing meetings. Healthcare providers can use it for documenting patient consultations.

In conclusion, the Speech Recognition System project offers hands-on experience with audio processing, machine learning, and AI-based interaction design. It enhances understanding of both traditional and modern NLP techniques while building a tool that has practical use in numerous industries. This project is not only a technical challenge but also a valuable contribution to accessible and intelligent computing.
